# FiniteStateMachine

This VHDL code implements a finite state machine (FSM) with three states A, B, and C. 
The FSM has one input In1, one reset input RST, one clock input CLK, and one output Out1. 
The FSM changes its state according to the input and outputs a signal Out1 depending on its current state.
